## S1Angle

The `S1Angle` class represents a one-dimensional angle (as opposed to a 2D solid
angle). It has methods for converting angles to or from radians, degrees, and
the E5/E6/E7 representations (i.e. degrees multiplied by 1e5/1e6/1e7 and rounded
to the nearest integer).

```c++
class S1Angle {
 public:
  // These methods construct S1Angle objects from their measure in radians
  // or degrees.
  static constexpr S1Angle Radians(double radians);
  static constexpr S1Angle Degrees(double degrees);
  static constexpr S1Angle E5(int32 e5);
  static constexpr S1Angle E6(int32 e6);
  static constexpr S1Angle E7(int32 e7);

  // The default constructor yields a zero angle.  This is useful for STL
  // containers and class methods with output arguments.
  constexpr S1Angle();

  // Return an angle larger than any finite angle.
  static constexpr S1Angle Infinity();

  // A explicit shorthand for the default constructor.
  static constexpr S1Angle Zero();

  // Return the angle between two points, which is also equal to the distance
  // between these points on the unit sphere.  The points do not need to be
  // normalized.
  S1Angle(const S2Point& x, const S2Point& y);

  // Like the constructor above, but return the angle (i.e., distance)
  // between two S2LatLng points.
  S1Angle(const S2LatLng& x, const S2LatLng& y);

  constexpr double radians() const;
  constexpr double degrees() const;

  int32 e5() const;
  int32 e6() const;
  int32 e7() const;

  // Return the absolute value of an angle.
  S1Angle abs() const;

  // Return the angle normalized to the range (-180, 180] degrees.
  S1Angle Normalized() const;

  // Normalize this angle to the range (-180, 180] degrees.
  void Normalize();
};
```

See `s1angle.h` for additional methods, including comparison and arithmetic
operators. For example, if `x` and `y` are angles, then you can write

    if (sin(0.5 * x) > (x + y) / (x - y)) { ... }

## S2Point

The `S2Point` class represents a point on the unit sphere as a 3D vector.
Usually points are normalized to be unit length, but some methods do not require
this. The `S2Point` class is simply a synonym for the `Vector_3d` class from
`util/math/vector.h`, which defines overloaded operators that make it convenient
to write arithmetic expressions (e.g. `x*p1 + (1-x)*p2`).

Some of its more useful methods include:

```c++
class S2Point /* Vector3_d */ {
 public:
  S2Point(double x, double y, double z);
  double x(), y(), z();                 // Named component accessors
  double& operator[](int i);            // Return component i (0, 1, 2)
  bool operator==(const S2Point& v);    // Equality testing
  bool operator!=(const S2Point& v);    // Inequality testing
  S2Point operator+=(const S2Point& v); // Add another vector
  S2Point operator-=(const S2Point& v); // Subtract another vector
  S2Point operator*=(double k);         // Multiply by a scalar
  S2Point operator/=(double k);         // Divide by a scalar
  S2Point operator+(const S2Point& v);  // Add two vectors
  S2Point operator-(const S2Point& v);  // Subtract two vectors
  S2Point operator*(double k);          // Multiply by a scalar
  S2Point operator/(double k);          // Divide by a scalar
  double DotProd(const S2Point& v);     // Dot product
  S2Point CrossProd(const S2Point& v);  // Cross product
  double Norm2();                       // Squared L2 norm
  double Norm();                        // L2 norm
  S2Point Normalize();                  // Return a normalized **copy**
  double Angle(const S2Point&v);        // Angle between two vectors (radians)
};
```

Note that the `S2Point` type is technically defined as follows:

    typedef Vector3<double> Vector3_d;
    typedef Vector3_d S2Point;

See `util/math/vector.h` for details and additional methods.

## S2LatLng

The `S2LatLng` class represents a point on the unit sphere as a pair of
latitude-longitude coordinates.

```c++
class S2LatLng {
 public:
  // Constructor.  The latitude and longitude are allowed to be outside
  // the is_valid() range.  However, note that most methods that accept
  // S2LatLngs expect them to be normalized (see Normalized() below).
  S2LatLng(S1Angle lat, S1Angle lng);

  // The default constructor sets the latitude and longitude to zero.  This is
  // mainly useful when declaring arrays, STL containers, etc.
  S2LatLng();

  // Convert a direction vector (not necessarily unit length) to an S2LatLng.
  explicit S2LatLng(const S2Point& p);

  // Returns an S2LatLng for which is_valid() will return false.
  static S2LatLng Invalid();

  // Convenience functions -- shorter than calling S1Angle::Radians(), etc.
  static S2LatLng FromRadians(double lat_radians, double lng_radians);
  static S2LatLng FromDegrees(double lat_degrees, double lng_degrees);
  static S2LatLng FromE5(int32 lat_e5, int32 lng_e5);
  static S2LatLng FromE6(int32 lat_e6, int32 lng_e6);
  static S2LatLng FromE7(int32 lat_e7, int32 lng_e7);

  // Accessor methods.
  S1Angle lat() const;
  S1Angle lng() const;
  const R2Point& coords() const;

  // Return true if the latitude is between -90 and 90 degrees inclusive
  // and the longitude is between -180 and 180 degrees inclusive.
  bool is_valid() const;

  // Clamps the latitude to the range [-90, 90] degrees, and adds or subtracts
  // a multiple of 360 degrees to the longitude if necessary to reduce it to
  // the range [-180, 180].
  S2LatLng Normalized() const;

  // Convert a normalized S2LatLng to the equivalent unit-length vector.
  S2Point ToPoint() const;

  // Return the distance (measured along the surface of the sphere) to the
  // given S2LatLng.  This is mathematically equivalent to:
  //
  //   S1Angle(ToPoint(), o.ToPoint())
  //
  // but this implementation is slightly more efficient.  Both S2LatLngs
  // must be normalized.
  S1Angle GetDistance(const S2LatLng& o) const;
};
```

See `s2latlng.h` for additional methods, including comparison and arithmetic
operators.

## S2Region

An `S2Region` represents a two-dimensional region over the unit sphere. It is an
abstract interface with various concrete subtypes, such as discs, rectangles,
polylines, polygons, geometry collections, buffered shapes, etc.

The main purpose of this interface is to allow complex regions to be
approximated as simpler regions. So rather than having a wide variety of virtual
methods that are implemented by all subtypes, the interface is restricted to
methods that are useful for computing approximations. Here they are:

```c++
class S2Region {
 public:
  virtual ~S2Region();

  // Return a deep copy of this region.  If you want to narrow the result to a
  // specific known region type, use down_cast<T*> from casts.h.
  // Subtypes return pointers to that subtype from their Clone() methods.
  virtual S2Region* Clone() const = 0;

  // Return a bounding spherical cap. This is not guaranteed to be exact.
  virtual S2Cap GetCapBound() const = 0;

  // Return a bounding latitude-longitude rectangle that contains the region.
  // The bounds are not guaranteed to be tight.
  virtual S2LatLngRect GetRectBound() const = 0;

  // If this method returns true, the region completely contains the given
  // cell.  Otherwise, either the region does not contain the cell or the
  // containment relationship could not be determined.
  virtual bool Contains(const S2Cell& cell) const = 0;

  // If this method returns false, the region does not intersect the given
  // cell.  Otherwise, either region intersects the cell, or the intersection
  // relationship could not be determined.
  virtual bool MayIntersect(const S2Cell& cell) const = 0;

  // Return true if and only if the given point is contained by the region.
  // The point 'p' is generally required to be unit length, although some
  // subtypes may relax this restriction.
  virtual bool Contains(const S2Point& p) const = 0;

  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // Many S2Region subtypes also define the following non-virtual methods.

  // Appends a serialized representation of the region to "encoder".
  void Encode(Encoder* const encoder) const;

  // Decodes an S2Region encoded with Encode().  Note that this method
  // requires that an S2Region object of the appropriate concrete type has
  // already been constructed.  It is not possible to decode regions of
  // unknown type.
  bool Decode(Decoder* const decoder);
};
```

See `s2region.h` for the full interface.

## S2LatLngRect

An `S2LatLngRect` is a type of `S2Region` that represents a rectangle in
latitude-longitude space. It is capable of representing the empty and full
rectangles as well as single points. It has an `AddPoint` method that makes it
easy to construct a bounding rectangle for a set of points, including point sets
that span the 180 degree meridian. Here are its methods:

```c++
class S2LatLngRect final : public S2Region {
 public:
  // Construct a rectangle from minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes.
  // If lo.lng() > hi.lng(), the rectangle spans the 180 degree longitude
  // line. Both points must be normalized, with lo.lat() <= hi.lat().
  // The rectangle contains all the points p such that 'lo' <= p <= 'hi',
  // where '<=' is defined in the obvious way.
  S2LatLngRect(const S2LatLng& lo, const S2LatLng& hi);

  // Construct a rectangle from latitude and longitude intervals.  The two
  // intervals must either be both empty or both non-empty, and the latitude
  // interval must not extend outside [-90, +90] degrees.
  S2LatLngRect(const R1Interval& lat, const S1Interval& lng);

  // The default constructor creates an empty S2LatLngRect.
  S2LatLngRect();

  // Construct a rectangle of the given size centered around the given point.
  static S2LatLngRect FromCenterSize(const S2LatLng& center,
                                     const S2LatLng& size);

  // Construct a rectangle containing a single (normalized) point.
  static S2LatLngRect FromPoint(const S2LatLng& p);

  // Construct the minimal bounding rectangle containing the two given
  // normalized points.  The points do not need to be ordered.
  static S2LatLngRect FromPointPair(const S2LatLng& p1, const S2LatLng& p2);

  // Accessor methods.
  S1Angle lat_lo() const;
  S1Angle lat_hi() const;
  S1Angle lng_lo() const;
  S1Angle lng_hi() const;
  const R1Interval& lat() const;
  const S1Interval& lng() const;
  R1Interval *mutable_lat();
  S1Interval *mutable_lng();
  S2LatLng lo() const;
  S2LatLng hi() const;

  // The canonical empty and full rectangles.
  static S2LatLngRect Empty();
  static S2LatLngRect Full();

  // Return true if the rectangle is valid, which essentially just means
  // that the latitude bounds do not exceed Pi/2 in absolute value and
  // the longitude bounds do not exceed Pi in absolute value.  Also, if
  // either the latitude or longitude bound is empty then both must be.
  bool is_valid() const;

  // Return true if the rectangle is empty, i.e. it contains no points at all.
  bool is_empty() const;

  // Return true if the rectangle is full, i.e. it contains all points.
  bool is_full() const;

  // Return true if the rectangle is a point, i.e. lo() == hi()
  bool is_point() const;

  // Return true if the rectangle crosses the 180 degree longitude line.
  bool is_inverted() const;

  // Return the k-th vertex of the rectangle (k = 0,1,2,3) in CCW order (lower
  // left, lower right, upper right, upper left).
  S2LatLng GetVertex(int k) const;

  // Return the center of the rectangle in latitude-longitude space
  // (in general this is not the center of the region on the sphere).
  S2LatLng GetCenter() const;

  // Return the width and height of this rectangle in latitude-longitude
  // space.  Empty rectangles have a negative width and height.
  S2LatLng GetSize() const;

  // Returns the surface area of this rectangle on the unit sphere.
  double Area() const;

  // Return the true centroid of the rectangle multiplied by its surface area.
  // The true centroid is the "center of mass" of the rectangle viewed as
  // subset of the unit sphere, i.e. it is the point in space about which this
  // curved shape would rotate.)
  //
  // The reason for multiplying the result by the rectangle area is to make it
  // easier to compute the centroid of more complicated shapes.
  S2Point GetCentroid() const;

  // More efficient version of Contains() that accepts a S2LatLng rather than
  // an S2Point.
  bool Contains(const S2LatLng& ll) const;

  // Return true if and only if the given point is contained in the interior
  // of the region (i.e. the region excluding its boundary).
  bool InteriorContains(const S2Point& p) const;

  // More efficient version of InteriorContains() that accepts a S2LatLng
  // rather than an S2Point.
  bool InteriorContains(const S2LatLng& ll) const;

  // Return true if and only if the rectangle contains the given other
  // rectangle.
  bool Contains(const S2LatLngRect& other) const;

  // Return true if and only if the interior of this rectangle contains all
  // points of the given other rectangle (including its boundary).
  bool InteriorContains(const S2LatLngRect& other) const;

  // Return true if this rectangle and the given other rectangle have any
  // points in common.
  bool Intersects(const S2LatLngRect& other) const;

  // Returns true if this rectangle intersects the given cell.  (This is an
  // exact test and may be fairly expensive, see also MayIntersect below.)
  bool Intersects(const S2Cell& cell) const;

  // Return true if and only if the interior of this rectangle intersects
  // any point (including the boundary) of the given other rectangle.
  bool InteriorIntersects(const S2LatLngRect& other) const;

  // Increase the size of the bounding rectangle to include the given point.
  // The rectangle is expanded by the minimum amount possible.
  void AddPoint(const S2Point& p);
  void AddPoint(const S2LatLng& ll);

  // Return a rectangle that has been expanded by margin.lat() on each side in
  // the latitude direction, and by margin.lng() on each side in the longitude
  // direction.  If either margin is negative, then shrink the rectangle on
  // the corresponding sides instead.  The resulting rectangle may be empty.
  //
  // If you are trying to grow a rectangle by a certain *distance* on the
  // sphere (e.g. 5km), use the ExpandedByDistance() method instead.
  S2LatLngRect Expanded(const S2LatLng& margin) const;

  // If the rectangle does not include either pole, return it unmodified.
  // Otherwise expand the longitude range to Full() so that the rectangle
  // contains all possible representations of the contained pole(s).
  S2LatLngRect PolarClosure() const;

  // Return the smallest rectangle containing the union of this rectangle and
  // the given rectangle.
  S2LatLngRect Union(const S2LatLngRect& other) const;

  // Return the smallest rectangle containing the intersection of this
  // rectangle and the given rectangle.  Note that the region of intersection
  // may consist of two disjoint rectangles, in which case a single rectangle
  // spanning both of them is returned.
  S2LatLngRect Intersection(const S2LatLngRect& other) const;

  // Expand this rectangle so that it contains all points within the given
  // distance of the boundary, and return the smallest such rectangle.  If the
  // distance is negative, then instead shrink this rectangle so that it
  // excludes all points within the given absolute distance of the boundary,
  // and return the largest such rectangle.
  //
  // Unlike Expanded(), this method treats the rectangle as a set of points on
  // the sphere, and measures distances on the sphere.  For example, you can
  // use this method to find a rectangle that contains all points within 5km
  // of a given rectangle.
  S2LatLngRect ExpandedByDistance(S1Angle distance) const;

  // Returns the minimum distance (measured along the surface of the sphere) to
  // the given S2LatLngRect. Both S2LatLngRects must be non-empty.
  S1Angle GetDistance(const S2LatLngRect& other) const;

  // Returns the minimum distance (measured along the surface of the sphere)
  // from a given point to the rectangle (both its boundary and its interior).
  S1Angle GetDistance(const S2LatLng& p) const;

```

## S1ChordAngle

The S2 library actually defines two angle representations, `S1Angle` and
`S1ChordAngle`.

`S1ChordAngle` is a specialized angle type that represents the distance
between two points on the sphere.  (Note that the distance between two
points can be expressed as the angle between those points measured from the
sphere's center.)  Its representation makes it very efficient for computing
and comparing distances, but unlike `S1Angle` it is only capable of
representing angles between 0 and 180 degrees.  (Internally, `S1ChordAngle`
computes the squared distance between two points through the interior of
the sphere, i.e. the squared length of the chord between those points).

`S1ChordAngle` is the preferred representation for distances internally,
because it is much faster to compute than `S1Angle` and also supports the
exact predicates needed for robust geometric algorithms.  `S1ChordAngle`
supports many of the same methods as `S1Angle`, and it is also easy to
convert back and forth as required.

## S2Cap

An `S2Cap` represents a spherical cap, i.e. a portion of a sphere cut off by a
plane. This is the equivalent of a *closed disc* in planar geometry (i.e., a
circle together with its interior), so if you are looking for a way to represent
a circle or disc then you are probably looking for an `S2Cap`.

Here are the methods available:

```c++
class S2Cap final : public S2Region {
 public:
  // The default constructor returns an empty S2Cap.
  S2Cap();

  // Construct a cap with the given center and radius.  A negative radius
  // yields an empty cap; a radius of 180 degrees or more yields a full cap
  // (containing the entire sphere).
  S2Cap(const S2Point& center, S1Angle radius);

  // Convenience function that creates a cap containing a single point.  This
  // method is more efficient that the S2Cap(center, radius) constructor.
  static S2Cap FromPoint(const S2Point& center);

  // Return a cap with the given center and height.  (The height of a cap is
  // the distance from the cap center to the cutoff plane; see comments
  // above.)  A negative height yields an empty cap; a height of 2 or more
  // yields a full cap.
  static S2Cap FromCenterHeight(const S2Point& center, double height);

  // Return a cap with the given center and surface area.  Note that the area
  // can also be interpreted as the solid angle subtended by the cap (because
  // the sphere has unit radius).  A negative area yields an empty cap; an
  // area of 4*Pi or more yields a full cap.
  static S2Cap FromCenterArea(const S2Point& center, double area);

  // Return an empty cap, i.e. a cap that contains no points.
  static S2Cap Empty();

  // Return a full cap, i.e. a cap that contains all points.
  static S2Cap Full();

  // Accessor methods.
  const S2Point& center() const;
  S1ChordAngle radius() const;
  double height() const;

  // Return the cap radius.  (This method is relatively expensive since only
  // the cap height is stored internally, and may yield a slightly different
  // result than the value passed to the (center, radius) constructor.)
  S1Angle GetRadius() const;

  // Return the area of the cap.
  double GetArea() const;

  // Return the true centroid of the cap multiplied by its surface area.  Note
  // that if you just want the "surface centroid", i.e. the normalized result,
  // then it is much simpler just to call center().
  //
  // The reason for multiplying the result by the cap area is to make it
  // easier to compute the centroid of more complicated shapes.
  S2Point GetCentroid() const;

  // We allow negative heights (to represent empty caps) but heights are
  // normalized so that they do not exceed 2.
  bool is_valid() const;

  // Return true if the cap is empty, i.e. it contains no points.
  bool is_empty() const;

  // Return true if the cap is full, i.e. it contains all points.
  bool is_full() const;

  // Return the complement of the interior of the cap.  A cap and its
  // complement have the same boundary but do not share any interior points.
  S2Cap Complement() const;

  // Return true if and only if this cap contains the given other cap
  // (in a set containment sense, e.g. every cap contains the empty cap).
  bool Contains(const S2Cap& other) const;

  // Return true if and only if this cap intersects the given other cap,
  // i.e. whether they have any points in common.
  bool Intersects(const S2Cap& other) const;

  // Return true if and only if the interior of this cap intersects the
  // given other cap.  (This relationship is not symmetric, since only
  // the interior of this cap is used.)
  bool InteriorIntersects(const S2Cap& other) const;

  // Return true if and only if the given point is contained in the interior
  // of the cap (i.e. the cap excluding its boundary).
  bool InteriorContains(const S2Point& p) const;

  // Increase the cap height if necessary to include the given point.  If the
  // cap is empty then the center is set to the given point, but otherwise the
  // center is not changed.
  void AddPoint(const S2Point& p);

  // Increase the cap height if necessary to include "other".  If the current
  // cap is empty it is set to the given other cap.
  void AddCap(const S2Cap& other);

  // Return a cap that contains all points within a given distance of this
  // cap.  Note that any expansion of the empty cap is still empty.
  S2Cap Expanded(S1Angle distance) const;

  // Return the smallest cap which encloses this cap and "other".
  S2Cap Union(const S2Cap& other) const;

## S2Polyline

An `S2Polyline` represents a sequence of zero or more vertices connected by
straight edges (geodesics). Edges of length 0 and 180 degrees are not allowed,
i.e. adjacent vertices should not be identical or antipodal.

```c++
class S2Polyline final : public S2Region {
 public:
  // Creates an empty S2Polyline that should be initialized by calling Init()
  // or Decode().
  S2Polyline();

  // Convenience constructors that call Init() with the given vertices.
  explicit S2Polyline(const std::vector<S2Point>& vertices);
  explicit S2Polyline(const std::vector<S2LatLng>& vertices);

  ~S2Polyline();

  // Initialize a polyline that connects the given vertices. Empty polylines are
  // allowed.  Adjacent vertices should not be identical or antipodal.  All
  // vertices should be unit length.
  void Init(const std::vector<S2Point>& vertices);

  // Convenience initialization function that accepts latitude-longitude
  // coordinates rather than S2Points.
  void Init(const std::vector<S2LatLng>& vertices);

  // Return true if the given vertices form a valid polyline.
  bool IsValid() const;

  // Returns true if this is *not* a valid polyline and sets "error"
  // appropriately.  Otherwise returns false and leaves "error" unchanged.
  bool FindValidationError(S2Error* error) const;

  // Accessor methods.
  int num_vertices() const;
  const S2Point& vertex(int k) const;

  // Return the length of the polyline.
  S1Angle GetLength() const;

  // Return the true centroid of the polyline multiplied by the length of the
  // polyline.  Prescaling by the polyline length makes it easy to compute the
  // centroid of several polylines (by simply adding up their centroids).
  S2Point GetCentroid() const;

  // Return the point whose distance from vertex 0 along the polyline is the
  // given fraction of the polyline's total length.  Fractions less than zero
  // or greater than one are clamped.  The return value is unit length.
  S2Point Interpolate(double fraction) const;

  // Like Interpolate(), but also return the index of the next polyline
  // vertex after the interpolated point P.  This allows the caller to easily
  // construct a given suffix of the polyline by concatenating P with the
  // polyline vertices starting at "next_vertex".
  S2Point GetSuffix(double fraction, int* next_vertex) const;

  // The inverse operation of GetSuffix/Interpolate.  Given a point on the
  // polyline, returns the ratio of the distance to the point from the
  // beginning of the polyline over the length of the polyline.  The return
  // value is always betwen 0 and 1 inclusive.  See GetSuffix() for the
  // meaning of "next_vertex".
  double UnInterpolate(const S2Point& point, int next_vertex) const;

  // Given a point, returns a point on the polyline that is closest to the given
  // point.  See GetSuffix() for the meaning of "next_vertex".
  S2Point Project(const S2Point& point, int* next_vertex) const;

  // Returns true if the point given is on the right hand side of the polyline,
  // using a naive definition of "right-hand-sideness" where the point is on
  // the RHS of the polyline iff the point is on the RHS of the line segment in
  // the polyline which it is closest to.
  bool IsOnRight(const S2Point& point) const;

  // Return true if this polyline intersects the given polyline. If the
  // polylines share a vertex they are considered to be intersecting.
  bool Intersects(const S2Polyline* line) const;

  // Reverse the order of the polyline vertices.
  void Reverse();

  // Return a subsequence of vertex indices such that the polyline connecting
  // these vertices is never further than "tolerance" from the original
  // polyline.
  void SubsampleVertices(S1Angle tolerance, std::vector<int>* indices) const;

  // Return true if "covered" is within "max_error" of a contiguous subpath of
  // this polyline over its entire length.  Specifically, this method returns
  // true if this polyline has parameterization a:[0,1] -> S^2, "covered" has
  // parameterization b:[0,1] -> S^2, and there is a non-decreasing function
  // f:[0,1] -> [0,1] such that distance(a(f(t)), b(t)) <= max_error for all t.
  //
  // You can think of this as testing whether it is possible to drive a car
  // along "covered" and a car along some subpath of this polyline such that no
  // car ever goes backward, and the cars are always within "max_error" of each
  // other.
  bool NearlyCoversPolyline(const S2Polyline& covered,
                            S1Angle max_error) const;

## S2Loop

An `S2Loop` represents a simple spherical polygon. It consists of a single chain
of vertices where the first vertex is implicitly connected to the last. All
loops are defined to have a CCW orientation, i.e. the interior of the loop is on
the left side of the edges. This implies that a clockwise loop enclosing a small
area is interpreted to be a CCW loop enclosing a very large area.

Loops are not allowed to have any duplicate vertices (whether adjacent or not),
and non-adjacent edges are not allowed to intersect. Loops must have at least 3
vertices (except for the "empty" and "full" loops discussed below). These
restrictions make it possible to implement exact polygon-polygon containment and
intersection tests very efficiently. See `S2Builder` if your data does not meet
these requirements.

There are two special loops: the "empty" loop contains no points, while the
"full" loop contains all points. These loops do not have any edges, but to
preserve the invariant that every loop can be represented as a vertex chain,
they are defined as having exactly one vertex each (see kEmpty and kFull).

Point containment of loops is defined such that if the sphere is subdivided into
faces (loops), every point is contained by exactly one face. This implies that
loops do not necessarily contain their vertices.

## S2Polygon

An `S2Polygon` is an `S2Region` object that represents a polygon. A polygon is
defined by zero or more loops; recall that the interior of a loop is defined to
be its left-hand side (see `S2Loop`). There are two different conventions for
creating an `S2Polygon`:

*   `InitNested()` expects the input loops to be nested hierarchically. The
    polygon interior then consists of the set of points contained by an odd
    number of loops. So for example, a circular region with a hole in it would
    be defined as two CCW loops, with one loop containing the other. The loops
    can be provided in any order.

    When the orientation of the input loops is unknown, the nesting requirement
    is typically met by calling `S2Loop::Normalize()` on each loop (which
    inverts the loop if necessary so that it encloses at most half the sphere).
    But in fact any set of loops can be used as long as (1) there is no pair of
    loops that cross, and (2) there is no pair of loops whose union is the
    entire sphere.

*   `InitOriented()` expects the input loops to be oriented such that the
    polygon interior is on the left-hand side of every loop. So for example, a
    circular region with a hole in it would be defined using a CCW outer loop
    and a CW inner loop. The loop orientations must all be consistent; for
    example, it is not valid to have one CCW loop nested inside another CCW
    loop, because the region between the two loops is on the left-hand side of
    one loop and the right-hand side of the other.

Most clients will not call these methods directly; instead they should use
`S2Builder`, which has better support for dealing with imperfect data.

When the polygon is initialized, the given loops are automatically converted
into a canonical form consisting of "shells" and "holes". Shells and holes are
both oriented CCW, and are nested hierarchically. The loops are reordered to
correspond to a preorder traversal of the nesting hierarchy; `InitOriented()`
may also invert some loops.

Polygons may represent any region of the sphere with a polygonal boundary,
including the entire sphere (known as the "full" polygon). The full polygon
consists of a single full loop (see `S2Loop`), whereas the empty polygon has no
loops at all.

Polygons have the following restrictions:

*   Loops may not cross, i.e. the boundary of a loop may not intersect both the
    interior and exterior of any other loop.

*   Loops may not share edges, i.e. if a loop contains an edge AB, then no other
    loop may contain AB or BA.

*   Loops may share vertices, however no vertex may appear twice in a single
    loop (see `S2Loop`).

*   No loop may be empty. The full loop may appear only in the full polygon.
