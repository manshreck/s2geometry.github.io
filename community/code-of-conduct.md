This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,
available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/
This Code of Conduct is licensed under the Creative Commons 4.0.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
  attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or
  electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate
  in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all individuals associated with the project
community and their actions and behaviors both inside and outside of the project
spaces.

## Conflict Resolution and Enforcement

We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement
often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or
to engage in behavior that violates the project’s code of conduct.

If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to
address the behavior directly with those involved.  Many issues can be resolved
quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their
dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the
behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing
an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

Reports should be directed to the
<a href="mailto:s2geometry-io-admin@google.com">S2 Geometry Library Admin</a>,
the Project Steward for S2. It is the Project Steward’s duty to receive and
address reported violations of the code of conduct. The steward will then work
with a committee consisting of representatives from the Open Source Programs
Office and the Google Cloud Platform Open Source Strategy team.

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct
response.  We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow
up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent
expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces.  We will notify the
accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any
action is taken. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment
or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice. The Project
Steward will only affirmatively identify the reporter when it is necessary in
the resolution of the report and with permission from the reporter.
