A unique feature of the S2 library is that unlike traditional
geographic information systems, which represent data as flat
two-dimensional projections (similar to an atlas), the S2
library represents all data on a three-dimensional sphere
(similar to a globe). This makes it possible to build a worldwide
geographic database with no seams or singularities, using a
single coordinate system, and with low distortion everywhere 
compared to the true shape of the Earth. While the Earth is
not quite spherical, it is much closer to being a sphere
than it is to being flat!

If you want to learn more about the library, start by reading the
[Overview](about/overview) and
[QuickStart document](devguide/cpp/quickstart), then read the
introduction to the [basic types](devguide/basic_types)

## S2 Features

Notable features of the library include:

* Flexible support for spatial indexing, including the ability
  to approximate arbitrary regions as collections of discrete
  S2 cells. This feature makes it easy to build large distributed
  spatial indexes.
* Fast in-memory spatial indexing of collections of points,
  polylines, and polygons.
* Robust constructive operations (such as intersection, union, and
  simplification) and boolean predicates (such as testing for
  containment).
* Efficient query operations for finding nearby objects, measuring
  distances, computing centroids, etc.
* A flexible and robust implementation of snap rounding (a geometric
  technique that allows operations to be implemented 100% robustly
  while using small and fast coordinate representations).
* A collection of efficient yet exact mathematical predicates for
  testing relationships among geometric primitives.
* Extensive testing on Google's vast collection of geographic data.
* Flexible Apache 2.0 license.
