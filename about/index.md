This guide provides conceptual background for working with the
S2 Geometry Library.

If you haven't already done so, make sure you read our
[Overview](/about/overview).

S2 consists of source code repositories for C++ and Java. Upon
completing the overview, you will probably want to run through
the Quickstart:

* [C++ Quickstart](/devguide/cpp/quickstart)

(A Java Quickstart is envisioned soon.)
