This guide provides background information for starting work with
the S2 Geometry Library.

*   The S2 [Platforms Guide](platforms) denotes the prerequisites
    for installation of S2 on your system. This guide also
    provides build instructions for S2.
*   The S2 [Overview](overview) provides a conceptual introduction
    to S2, and should be read before diving into the developer
    guide.

S2 consists of source code repositories for C++ and Java. Upon
completing the overview, you will probably want to run through
the Quickstart:

* [C++ Quickstart](../devguide/cpp/quickstart)

(A Java Quickstart is envisioned soon.)
